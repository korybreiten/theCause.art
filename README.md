Where communities and artists create change through causes!

### Main Page

Causes are featured at the top and will have a row of donated auctions below each cause soon.
Next row down is the artists and they are ordered by funds but will be switched to CP (Cause Points) as soon as that system is implemented.
Below that is auctions also ordered by funds but may be random, or it may be influenced by CP in some way as well.

### Profile Page

For right now the email on the profile page is what is used for testing the PayPal API.
The profile is fairly basic aside from causes and auctions, which features a minimalistic design that still manages to tick all the boxes.
